Predicting profits for a food truck using linear regression

In this project, I have implemented linear regression with one
variable to predict profits for a food truck. 

Use Case:
Suppose an owner of a restaurant franchise is considering different cities for opening a new outlet. 
The franchise already has trucks in various cities and data has been previously collected for profits and populations from those cities.
You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.
